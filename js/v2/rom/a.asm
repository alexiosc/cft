;;; Detect memory without an MBU (check for default RAM/ROM mapping). We'll be

;;; Strategy:

;;;  * Flip its bits and write it back
;;;  * Load the value back
;;;  * If the bits are flipped, it's RAM.
;;;  * If the bits aren't flipped, it's ROM.
;;;  * If the value read is the value of the CFT instruction used to load that

;;; (*) Rationale: the data bus is terminated with bus hold circuitry, which
;;;     retails the last valid value the bus had driven onto it. If memory is
;;;     present, this would be the output of a memory IC. Otherwise, the
