# New VDU Notes

* Can we memory map it?
* 640Ã—480 top resolution
* Keep to 64 colours
* Planar setup (bitmap + colour planes, CG plane)
* Use display lists for modes


## Intrinsic mods

Vertical resolutions: 480, 240, 120, 60, 30.

Horizontal resolution: 640, 320, 160, 80, 40.


## Display Lists

Enterprise 64/128 display lists read/interpreted at start of scan line.

Each DP line contains:

* Row start address.
* Repetition counter (font height)
* Mode setting bits.
* Smooth scrolling?


## Problems to solve

* Cheap character cell scrolling
