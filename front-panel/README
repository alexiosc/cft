CFT COMBINATION FRONT PANEL AND REMOTE DEBUGGING / TESTING BOARD

==NAME/DESIGNATION==

To be decided.

==FEATURES==

The PFP combines and acts on instructions coming from three sources:

* The front panel switches.
* The debugging serial port.
* The CFT processor itself.

There are two modes of operation:

* Processor mode: the processor is present and is mostly used as the
  bus master by driving its control signals directly.

* Standalone mode: the processor is absent. The board drives the
  address and data buses directly.

==STATE==

===Power On State===

* Start on power on?
  - If FPRAM# switch in RAM position, start halted
  - Otherwise, start running
