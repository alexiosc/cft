\section{Introduction}

  This document discusses the architecture of the CFT computer from a
  programmer's perspective. The CFT is a solid-state, 16-bit
  architecture reminiscent, among others, of the DEC
  PDP-8.\footnote{Newer versions of this document and additional
    documentation and downloads may be found at the following URL:\\
    \link{www.bedroomlan.org/hardware/cft}.}

  The computer incorporates a 16-bit word, 65,536 words of addressable
  main memory and 65,536 words of input/output (I/O) space.

  Instructions are 16-bits. There are ten registers (five are 16-bits
  wide, the remaining five are single-bit flags) and a simple,
  orthogonal instruction set. The computer is able to initialise
  itself without operator intervention using read-only ROM and a
  hardwired, turn-key bootstrap address. Communication to the outside
  world is attained using an interrupt facility, as part of an
  expansion bus that connects to main memory and peripherals. An
  autoindexing feature allows for very tightly coded looping
  structures.

  The design is microcoded for ease of upgrading.

\section{Architecture}

The CFT is a Von Neumann architecture stored program computer. Data is
primarily manipulated in memory, using the system's single
general-purpose internal register as an intermediate. The design is
such that up to 1,024 general purpose memory-based registers may be
accessed at any time. The computer is completely solid-state,
implemented using modern 74xxx integrated circuits and some LSI
memory.

The datapath of the CFT computer is shown in~\fcf{fig-datapath}. For
simplicity, it is built around a single bus, the \IBUS. All major
registers are connected to this bus.

The computer is microcoded. This simplifies upgrading and patching the
architecture to provide new features. Microcode consists of a number
of microprograms, each handling one CFT major state or
instruction. Each microprogram consists of up to 16 24-bit
microinstructions which operate directly the various physical units in
the computer and control the connection of registers and units to the
\IBUS.

The entire architecture is built around a 16-bit word. All data and
instructions is stored in 16-bit quantities, and all registers except
two are 16 bits wide. This allows programs and data to share the same
16-bit memory, and also makes programming significantly easier. A
rational, orthogonal instruction set with 15 main instructions and a
number of sub-instructions allows for ease of programming, yet
significant versatility.

The computer has separate address spaces for memory and input/output
devices, allowing the two to be kept separate. Through microcode
alterations additional wait states may be introduced for I/O, while
leaving memory accesses fast. This also allows processor extensions to
be built in I/O space, such as multiplication and division units,
novel instructions, et cetera.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/datapath.pdf}\vspace{2em}\\
\caption{\label{fig-datapath} The CFT datapath is organised around a
  single internal bus, the \IBUS. The {\em Accumulator\/} (\A, bottom
  left) is the sole general-purpose internal register of the machine
  and is operated on by most instructions. A {\em Flag Unit\/} decodes
  the value of \A{} and accepts input from the \ALU{} to provide the
  basis for flow control. The \ALU{} performs all arithmetic and logic
  operations except register increments which are handled within the
  circuitry of those major registers that require it. The {\em Link\/}
  register (\Lreg) acts as a carry out register and extends \A{} by a
  single bit for certain operations. The {\em Control Unit\/} (centre)
  interprets microcode in response the the current instruction, which
  is stored in the {\em Instruction Register\/}. The {\em I Register}
  controls the reception of interrupts. The {\em Program Counter\/}
  (\PC) holds the location in memory of the next instruction to be
  fetched. The {\em Data Register\/} is an intermediate register used
  to implement indirect memory addressing. The {\em Memory Address
    Register\/} buffers addresses and directly drives the external
  address bus. The {\em Data Bus Transceiver\/} is a simple
  transceiver unit. When necessary, it connects the \IBUS{} to the
  external data bus to facilitate memory and I/O access. Finally, the
  {\em Constant Source\/} outputs to the \IBUS{} various constant
  values needed for resetting, address vectors, and other internal
  tasks.  }
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Word Size}

The word size is 16 bits. There are no facilities for accessing
quantities smaller than one word, and no single-instruction facilities
for accessing quantities longer than one word.

In this context, one kiloword (KWord) is $2^{10}$ or 1,024 kilowords.

\subsection{Data Types}

CFT defines a single data type: a 16-bit unsigned integer,
i.e. integers in the range 0â€“65,535. There are no instructions
explicitly intended to handle signed numbers, but two's complement
operations may still be performed and the hardware has been designed
to make this easier.

\subsection{Addressing}

The CFT architecture can address up to 64~KWords of memory, plus up to
64~KWords of I/O space\footnote{Although, for practical reasons, 1
  KWord of I/O space is more readily available.}.

\subsubsection{Memory Space}

Main memory is split up into 64 {\em pages\/}, each 1 KWord in
size. Instructions usually reference memory addresses relative to the
page they are executing in.

The first page, Page Zero, is given special treatment by the
instruction set. If bit 10 (starting at zero) of an instruction is
clear, addresses in Page Zero may be accessed. This is the fastest and
most convenient way of accessing memory beyond the current page. As
such, Page Zero is always used for system variables, constants and
other data that must be globally accessible.

The 128 words in Zero Page addresses \hex{0080}â€“\hex{00FF} (inclusive)
are so-called Autoindex registers. Using the Autoindex addressing
mode, each time one of these addresses is referenced, it is
automatically incremented by one. This allows loops to be coded very
tightly, with index register increments happening at the microcode
level.

    \hex{FFFF} & Highest memory address.\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{fig-mm}Memory map of the CFT CPU's memory space.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{I/O Space}

Although there are 64 KWords of I/O space, this is limited by
practical limitations: Only the first 1,024 I/O addresses may be
accessed from anywhere in memory space. Due to page-relative
addressing, accessing the rest of the I/O space is mostly convenient
via indirect addressing. For speed and ease of use, most I/O devices
will thus occupy the first KWord of address space. Page-relative
addressing is discussed in detail in \cf{sec-pagerel}.

  \caption{\label{fig-rf}Full Register file. Only the \A{} major
    register and the five flag registers are accessible to the user,
    and only \A{} is directly accessible.}

\end{figure}

There are ten registers in the CFT architecture. They are split into
the major registers, minor registers, and flag registers. Major and
minor registers are all 16 bits wide. Flag registers are one bit wide.

\subsubsection{Major Registers}

These registers are used directly by the programming model. These are
all 16-bit registers. They hardware provides facilities for these
registers to be read, written and incremented.

\paragraph{Accumulator (\A)}

This is a 16 bit register. It is the only 16-bit register directly and
fully accessible via the instruction set and the one almost all
instructions operate on. The value of \A{} influences directly the
values of the flag registers \Nreg (negative flag) and \Zreg (zero
flag).

\paragraph{Program Counter (\PC)}

A 16-bit register. It contains the address of the next instruction to
be executed. It may not be read, but can be indirectly affected by way
of skips, jumps, subroutine calls, traps, and interrupts.

\paragraph{Data Register (\DR)}

This is a 16-bit register used internally by the CFT to buffer
addresses during indirect addressing. It cannot be accessed directly
by the user.



\subsubsection{Minor Registers}

These registers are used internally by the system, and are built with
less functionality than major registers.

\paragraph{Instruction Register (\IR)}

The Instruction Register (\IR) holds the instruction currently being
executed. It is 16 bits wide and is used internally only. There is no
way to access it.

\paragraph{Address Register (\AR)}

The Address Register (\AR) is a 16-bit register that buffers addresses
that are put out on the CFT address bus. \AR{} is responsible for all
memory and I/O addressing with the exception of indirect addressing,
which also uses the \DR. Like the \IR, the {\AR} cannot be accessed by
the user.

\subsubsection{Flag Registers}

These are single-bit flags. They are used to sense or set the state of
the system and form the basis of flow control.

\paragraph{Link Register (\Lreg)}

Used as a carry bit during arithmetic, extending the \A{} register and
as the 17th bit during roll instructions. It may be used as a generic
flag by user programs and may be set or cleared by user programs.

\paragraph{Negative Flag (\Nreg)}

Directly linked to 16th bit of the \A{} register. This register may
not be directly controlled by the programmer. If set, the \A{}
register may be negative. This, of course, depends on the
interpretation of the contents of \A{}. If treating \A{} as an
unsigned quantity, the \Nreg{} register is a good means of testing the
highest-order bit of \A{}.

\paragraph{Zero Flag (\Zreg)}

Cannot be controlled directly by the user. This flag register is set
when \A{} is zero. This is among the fastest means of numerical
comparison on the CFT architecture.

\paragraph{Overflow Flag (\Vreg)}

Cannot be controlled directly by the user. This flag is set when an
addition results in a result that will not fit in 16 bits. Its
interpretation depends on the interpretation of the value of \A.

\paragraph{Interrupt Register (\Ireg)}

This single-bit register controls the computer's behaviour on
detecting an interrupt request. The register may be manipulated by the
user to allow or mask interrupts.

    \end{pspicture}
  \end{pdfpic}
  \caption{\label{fig-if}Instruction Format of the CFT architecture.}
\end{figure}

The CFT computer uses a single instruction format. All instructions are exactly
16 bits wide and comprise the same fields, as shown in~\fcf{fig-if}. Each
instruction contains four fields. From most to least significant, they are:

\begin{description}
\item{\bf The Instruction opcode (most significant 4 bits)}. This
  field identifies the instruction to be performed.
\item{\bf The Indirection mode (1 bit)}. Depending on the instruction,
  this bit selects between the literal and direct, or the direct and
  indirect addressing mode.
\item{\bf The Register Mode (1 bit)}. This bit controls whether
  addresses and literals are relative to the current page, or relative
  to page zero (the register page).
\item{\bf The Operand or address offset (least significant 10
  bits)}. This allows only ten bits of literals or addresses to be
  specified in an instruction. The most significant six bits are
  filled in from one of two sources as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the Register Mode bit is set (1), the six most significant bits
    of the \PC\ register are used. This is page-relative addressing.
  \item If the Register Mode bit is clear (0), the six most
    significant bits of the operand are zero. This is Register
    addressing, also known as Page-Zero addressing, since Page Zero is
    used for system registers.
  \end{itemize}
  This introduces a number of limitations, discussed in~\cf{sec-pagerel}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Page-Relative Limitations}
\label{sec-pagerel}

Unless the Register Mode (R) bit is set (field R in the instruction
equal to {\sf 1}), an instruction at address {\tt addr} may only access
memory (and I/O) address between {\tt addr AND FC00} and {\tt (ADDR
  AND FC00) OR 3FF}. This introduces a number of limitations and
defines the programming style of CFT more than any other single aspect
of the design.

There are four obvious solutions to the limitation:

Subprograms need to store temporary data on the local page, or to use
special â€˜scratchâ€™ registers in Page Zero. Both addressing modes take
the same time to execute.

In the case of constants, the programmer can either limit themselves
to constants in the range \hex{0000}â€“\hex{03FF}, store commonly-used
large constants (such as -1, \hex{FFFF} and -2, \hex{FFFE}) in a Page
Zero constant table, or a combination of these techniques\footnote{A
  note for PDP-8 programmers: the CFT has a {\tt LI} (Load Immediate)
  instruction that can load the Accumulator with a 10-bit
  literal. This is considerably faster the the only PDP-8 alternative,
  constructing basic constants using microcoded instructions.}.

Special care needs to be taken for subprograms longer than 1,024
words. If code crosses a page boundary, references to any local data
will in fact refer to the same offset within the {\tt new\/} page, and
will of course be invalid.

The standard assembler issues a cross-page warning when using symbolic
names (labels) for such local data, which is a very good practice.

Jumps, subroutine calls and traps suffer from the same issue. Indirect
Register addressing is commonly used as a solution to this problem:
the address (vector) of the subprogram in question is stored in a Page
Zero location, and the jump is made using indirection. This has the
added benefit of allowing the vectors to be changed so that system
services may be overridden.

Perhaps the most significant limitation, however, is on the size of
the I/O address space. When performing page-relative I/O operations
({\tt IN}, {\tt OUT} and {\tt IOT}), the most significant six bits of
the I/O address will {\em still\/} be taken from the six most
significant bits of the \PC. Because of this, different I/O devices
will be accessed depending on the location of the program in
memory. There are two ways to avoid this: the primary one is to only
use 10 bits of I/O space. Either the R field in all I/O instructions
must be {\sf 1}, or the hardware must decode only the 10 least significant
address lines\footnote{Thus providing six don't care bits, which is 64
  copies of every I/O device, one for every page.}, or a combination
of both. The secondary means of avoiding this issue is indirect
addressing. It is assumed that a mixture of these techniques will be
used in practice. Please refer to your system documentation for exact
details.

\subsection{Addressing Modes}

CFT instructions have two bits that modify how instructions treat the
operand field: the R (register) field, and the I (indirection)
field.

The R field controls how the six most significant bits of the operand
are derived, as described in~\cf{sec-if}.

The I field controls how the resultant operand is used. This depends
on the instruction.

Combined, there are up to four addressing modes per instruction. There
is also a fifth addressing mode, autoindex mode, which is selected for
specific memory addresses only. Each instruction supports five
addressing modes. 

Naturally, no instructions support all addressing modes. Depending on
the nature of the instruction, either literal and direct modes, or
direct and indirect modes are used. There also some instructions in
which the addressing mode does not apply. This is indicated as
â€˜specialâ€™ mode.

The addressing modes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Immediate.
  \item Immediate page-relative.
  \item Direct register.
  \item Direct page-relative.
  \item Indirect register.
  \item Indirect page-relative.
  \item Autoindex.
  \item Special.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Immediate Mode}

When using applicable instructions with R=0 and I=0, the value field
in the instruction is used as the least significant 10 bits of a
literal value. The most significant six bits are zero. This allows
literal values in the range \hex{0000}â€“\hex{03FF} to be specified.

For example, executing the Load Immediate (LI R) instruction {\tt LI R
  0350} will set \A=\hex{0350}.

\subsubsection{Immediate Page-Relative Mode}

When using applicable instructions with with R=1 and I=0, the value
field in the instruction is used as the least significant 10 bits of a
literal value. The six most significant bits of the \PC\ are used as the
most significant six bits of that value. This allows addresses in the
current page to be specified.

For example, executing the Load Address (LIA) instruction {\tt LIA
  0042} at address \hex{2130} will set \A=\hex{2042}.

\subsubsection{Direct Register Mode}

When using applicable instructions with R=1 and I=0, the value field
in the instruction is used as the least significant 10 bits of a
memory or I/O address. The most significant six bits are zero. This
allows Page Zero registers and I/O devices to be addressed.

For example, executing the Load instruction {\tt LOAD R 0010}
instruction will load the contents of address \hex{0010} into \A.

\subsubsection{Direct Page-Relative Mode}

When using applicable instructions with R=0 and I=0, the six most
significant bits of the \PC{} and the ten least significant bits of
the value field in the instruction are used to construct an address
which is used directly to reference a value in memory or I/O
space. This is the most commonly used addressing mode.

For example, executing the Store instruction {\tt STORE 0010} at
address \hex{8514} will write the contents of \A\  onto memory address
\hex{8410}.

\subsubsection{Indirect Register Mode}

When using applicable instructions with R=1 and I=1, the value field
in the instruction is used to construct an address. The 16-bit value
{\em at that address in memory\/} is used to reference memory or I/O
space.

For example, executing the LOAD instruction {\tt LOAD I 009A} will
read into the \DR register a 16-bit value from memory location {\tt
  009A}. \A\  will then be loaded with the value of the address in
memory stored in \DR.

\subsubsection{Indirect Page-Relative Mode}

When using applicable instructions with R=0 and I=1, the six most
significant bits of the \PC{} and the ten least significant bits of
the value field in the instruction are used to construct an
address. The 16-bit value at that address in memory is used to
reference memory or I/O space.

For example, executing the LOAD instruction {\tt LOAD I 009A} at
address \hex{1234} will read into the Data Register a 16-bit value
from memory location \hex{109A}. That number is treated as the address
in memory to be read into \A.

\subsubsection{Autoindex Mode}

Autoindex mode operates like Indirect Register Mode above, but the
memory location indicated in the instruction field is {\em
  incremented\/} after being used. Indirect Autoindex mode cannot be
selected directly. It is automatically enabled for addresses in the
range \hex{0080}â€“\hex{00FF}. The value of the R field is immaterial,
only the resultant address is examined.

For example, executing the LOAD instruction {\tt LOAD I R 009A} will
read into the \DR register a 16-bit value from memory location
\hex{109A}. That number is used as the address in memory to be read
into \A, then incremented by one and written back to location
\hex{009A}.

If the instruction were {\tt LOAD I 009A} and it executed at address
\hex{0003}, the result would have been the same.

\subsection{Operating States}

The CFT processor has four major operating states: initialisation, interrupt,
operation and waiting.

\subsubsection{Initialisation}

When the computer initialises via a system reset or initial boot, it
first clears the major registers \A, \PC{} and \DR{}. Shortly after
the reset pulse, \PC{} is loaded with the boot address \hex{FFF0} and
the \Ireg\ register is cleared in order to disallow interrupts.  Other
registers and machine states are undefined and may contain arbitrary
values â€” naturally, boot code should initialise all of the system as
early as possible. Normal operation is then resumed.

\subsubsection{Interrupt}

When the computer encounters an interrupt, and if the \Ireg\ register is {\tt
  1} (allowing interrupts), the event is buffered in a minor state
register. When the currently executing instruction is completed, the
\Ireg\ register is cleared to disable further interrupts and the current value
of the \PC\ is written to memory address \hex{0002}. Finally, the \PC\ is
loaded with the value \hex{FFF8}, which is the address of the Interrupt Service
Routine (ISR). Normal operation is then resumed.

\subsubsection{Operation}

During normal fetch-execute operation, the computer's microcode
fetches instructions from main memory address indicated by \PC,
increments the \PC, then executes the fetched instructions. This is the
mode the computer spends most of its time in.

\subsubsection{Wait}

On occasion, external slow hardware or the operator's console may halt
the processor's clocks. In this state, the sequencer does not work
through the microcode and the computer does not operate.

This mode may be entered at any time. The operator's console allows it
to be entered either inside a microprogram, or immediately before the
fetch part.

The Wait state is transient: as soon as the appropriate signals are
de-asserted by the hardware, the previous state resumes.

\section{Instruction Set Reference}

The first edition of the CFT microcode allowed for fourteen different
instructions. The second edition added the {\tt IOT} instruction,
which makes for fifteen mutually orthogonal instructions:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt TRAP}: save the \PC\ and jump to the specified location. Used for operating system services.
\item {\tt IOT}: new in version 2.0 of the microcode. Writes to a specified output device, then reads a result back from it. Used to implement computer extensions via I/O-addressable extension units.
\item {\tt LOAD}: load from memory.
\item {\tt STORE}: write to memory.
\item {\tt IN}: read from an input device.
\item {\tt OUT}: write to an output device.
\item {\tt JMP}: unconditional jump to the specified location.
\item {\tt JSR}: save the \PC\ and jump unconditionally to the specified location.
\item {\tt ADD}: load from memory and add to the accumulator.
\item {\tt AND}: load from memory and perform a bitwise AND with the value in the accumulator.
\item {\tt OR}: load from memory and perform a bitwise OR with the value in the accumulator.
\item {\tt XOR}: load from memory and perform a bitwise exclusive OR with the value in the accumulator.
\item {\tt OP1}: minor operations, group one.
\item {\tt OP2}: minor operations, group two.
\item {\tt INCM}: new in version 3.0 of the microcode. Loads a memory
  value into \A, increments it, and writes it back. The incremented
  value remains in \A{}. This simplifies coding loops.
\item {\tt LIA}: load accumulator with literal value or address.
\end{itemize}

To simplify understanding of the instruction set, opcode mnemonics are
used rather than actual machine code. In many cases, the notation used
is that of the Standard CFT Assembly language which merits some
description. This is not a full definition of CFT Assembly language,
merely enough of it to facilitate discussing the instruction set in
a more human-readable form.

CFT Assemblers parse lexical tokens denoting either symbolic
instruction names or hexadecimal numbers. Symbols are converted to
numbers using symbol tables. The resultant numbers, which must be 16
bits in width, are ORred together to form an instruction\footnote{One
  exception is the {\tt R} symbol, which {\em clears\/} bit 10 of the
  instruction to turn on Page Zero/register addressing modes. In
  practice, this is not actually an exception. After assembling an
  instruction, however, the Assembler performs an {\tt XOR} with the
  hexadecimal value \hex{0400} (complementing bit 10), which allows
  the bitwise Or semantics to work for everything, including the R
  flag, and the resultant code to run as expected.}.

This provides great simplicity and generality at the expense of making
the code slightly less readable from a modern Assembly
perspective\footnote{PDP-8 Assembly programmers will feel right at
  home, though.}).

Anything after the first semicolon ({\tt ;}) on a line is considered a
comment and ignored.

A brief example of CFT Assembly language can be found in~\fcf{fig-asm}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Memory}

The following instructions operate on memory space.

\subsubsection{{\tt LOAD} â€” Load Accumulator}
\label{sec-load}

Load a word from memory into \A. Direct, indirect and autoindex modes are available.

\subsubsection{{\tt STORE} â€” Store Accumulator}
\label{sec-store}

Write \A\ to the specified memory location. Direct, indirect and autoindex modes are available.

\subsubsection{{\tt INCM} â€” Load and Increment Memory}
\label{sec-incm}

Load a word from memory to \A. Increment \A{}, and write it back to
the same memory location. Direct, indirect and autoindex modes are
available. In autoindex mode, autoincrement occurs only once, after
the memory write.

\subsection{I/O}

The following instructions operate on I/O space.

\subsubsection{{\tt IN} â€” Read from I/O Device}
\label{sec-in}

Read a word from I/O space into \A. Direct, Indirect and autoindex

Indirect and autoindex modes are available. {\tt OUT} instructions
almost always have side-effects that depend on the peripheral being
addressed.

\subsubsection{{\tt IOT} â€” I/O Transaction}
\label{sec-iot}

Implements a processor extension. The {\tt IOT} instruction writes A
to I/O space, the reads \A{} back from the same address. The I/O-mapped
processor extension can introduce wait states at the end of the I/O
space read cycle, in order to get more time to perform its
task. Direct, Indirect and autoindex modes are available.

\subsection{Arithmetic and Logic}

The following instructions perform common arithmetic and logic operations.

\subsubsection{{\tt ADD} â€” Add to Accumulator}
\label{sec-add}

Read a word from memory and add it to \A. If the addition results in a
carry-out, \Lreg\  is toggled. Direct, Indirect and autoindex modes are
available.

\subsubsection{{\tt AND} â€” Bitwise And with Accumulator}

the \PC to the address specified in the instruction. Direct, Indirect
and autoindex modes are available.

\subsubsection{{\tt JMP} â€” Jump to Address}
\label{sec-jmp}

Sets the \PC to the address specified in the instruction. Direct,
Indirect and autoindex modes are available.

\subsubsection{{\tt JSR} â€” Jump to Subroutine}
\label{sec-jsr}

Writes the value of the \PC to memory location \hex{0000}, then sets
the \PC to the address specified in the instruction. Direct, Indirect
and autoindex modes are available.

\subsection{Specials}

These are operations that do not fit in the categories above.

\subsubsection{{\tt OP1} â€” Operations 1}
\label{sec-op1}

\begin{figure*}[tb]
  \centering
  \input{rolls.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig-roll}Roll Instructions.}
\end{figure*}

The {\tt OP1} instruction provides a number of minor operations, any
number of which may be performed in a preset order. This is very
similar to the PDP-8 â€˜microcodedâ€™ instructions.

The operand of the {\tt OP1} instruction is seen as a bitfield, where
set bits trigger a particular minor operation. The table below
outlines the possible operations that can be ORred together.

\vspace{1em}\noindent\begin{center}
\zebra
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Bitfield & {\tt OP1} Instruction \\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
  {\tt 1---------} & {\tt IFL} â€” Execute the rest only if \Lreg{} set.\\
  {\tt -1--------} & {\tt IFV} â€” Execute the rest only if \Vreg{} set.\\
  {\tt --1-------} & {\tt CLA} â€” Clear \A \\
  {\tt ---1------} & {\tt CLL} â€” Clear \Lreg \\
  {\tt ----1-----} & {\tt NOT} â€” Complement \A \\
  {\tt -----1----} & {\tt INC} â€” Increment (\Lreg,\A) by one. \\
  {\tt ------1---} & {\tt CPL} â€” Complement \Lreg \\
  {\tt -------010} & {\tt RBL} â€” Roll Bit Left (\Lreg,\A) \\
  {\tt -------001} & {\tt RBR} â€” Roll Bit Right (\Lreg,\A) \\
  {\tt -------110} & {\tt RNL} â€” Roll Nybble Left (\Lreg,\A) \\
  {\tt -------101} & {\tt RNR} â€” Roll Nybble Right (\Lreg,\A) \\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}\vspace{1em}

These operations is performed in the order in which they appear above,
from top to bottom. If no operations are specified, i.e. the
instruction is \hex{C000}, the instruction is effectively a NOP. The
four roll instructions are mutually exclusive. The notation (\Lreg,\A)
indicates that both \Lreg\ and \A\ are used together as a 17-bit
quantity, with \Lreg\ becoming the most significant bit.

The first two operations end execution of the rest of the instruction
unless the \Lreg{} and \Vreg{} are set, respectively. These operations
simplify the rippling of carry, borrow or overflow effects.

To clear both \A{} and \Lreg, the instruction would be {\tt OP1 CLA CLL}.

If the {\tt INC} instruction is issued when \A=\hex{FFFF}, \Lreg\ is
toggled. As expected, \A\ becomes \hex{0000}.

To calculate the two's complement of \A{} {\tt OP1 NOT INC} (hexadecimal
instruction \hex{C030}) will first invert \A{}, then increment it by
one. Note that {\tt OP1 INC NOT} has exactly the same result, as the
order in which minor operations are performed is fixed.

A binary left shift by one bit can be defined as {\tt OP1 CLL RBL}
(\hex{C102}).

The standard Assembler defines many of these combinations of 
instructions as
convenient macros. When using these macros, specifying {\tt OP1} is
optional.

The exact operation of the four roll instructions is illustrated
in~\npfcf{fig-roll}.

\subsubsection{{\tt OP2} â€” Operations 2}
\label{sec-op2}

This instruction is very similar to the {\tt OP1} instruction. The
main feature of the {\tt OP2} instruction is skipping. Skip
instructions skip over the following instruction if the corresponding
condition is true. Conditions involve the \A{} and \Lreg{} registers. The
following table lists the {\tt OP2} bitfield values that may be ORred
together.

\vspace{1em}\noindent\begin{center}
\zebra
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Bitfield & {\tt OP2} Instruction \\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
  {\tt -----01---} & {\tt SNA} â€” Skip if \A{} negative (G1)\\
  {\tt -----0-1--} & {\tt SZA} â€” Skip if \A{} zero (G1) \\
  {\tt -----0--1-} & {\tt SSL} â€” Skip if \Lreg{} set (G1) \\
  {\tt -----0---1} & {\tt SSV} â€” Skip if \Vreg{} set (G1) \\
  {\tt -----10000} & {\tt SKIP} â€” Always skip (G2) \\
  {\tt -----11---} & {\tt SNN} â€” Skip if \A{} non-negative (G2) \\
  {\tt -----1-1--} & {\tt SNZ} â€” Skip if \A{} non-zero (G2) \\
  {\tt -----1--1-} & {\tt SCL} â€” Skip if \Lreg{} clear (G2) \\
  {\tt -----1---1} & {\tt SCV} â€” Skip if \Vreg{} clear (G2) \\
  {\tt --1-------} & {\tt CLA} â€” Clear \A{} \\
  {\tt ---1------} & {\tt CLI} â€” Clear \Ireg{} flag \\
  {\tt ----1-----} & {\tt STI} â€” Set \Ireg{} flag \\%
  \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}\vspace{1em}

There are two groups of branching instructions: G1 (bit 4 of the
instruction operand is {\tt 0}) and G2 (bit 4 of the instruction
operand is {\tt 1}). When G1 instructions {\tt SNA}, {\tt SZA}, {\tt
  SSL} and {\tt SSV} are specified together, the skip is performed
when {\em any\/} of the specified conditions hold (logical disjunction
or Or). For example, the instruction {\tt SZA SNA} is â€˜skip if \A{} less
than or equal to zeroâ€™, or â€˜skip if \A{} non-positiveâ€™ (which is the
standard CFT Assembly macro {\tt SNP}).

When G2 instructions are specified together, the skip is performed
when {\em all\/} of the specified conditions hold (logical conjunction
or And). For example, {\tt SNN SNZ} is â€˜skip if \A{} is non-zero and
non-negativeâ€™, or â€˜skip if \A{} is positiveâ€™ (the standard Assembler
macro for this is {\tt SPA}). The full set of combinations to check
the value of \Areg{} is as follows:

\vspace{1em}\noindent\begin{center}
\zebra
\begin{tabular}{lll}
  Instruction & Macro & Semantics \\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
  {\tt SNA }     &           & Skip if $\mbox{A} < 0$ \\
  {\tt SNA SZA } & {\tt SNP} & Skip if $\mbox{A} \leq 0$ \\
  {\tt SZA }     &           & Skip if $\mbox{A} = 0$ \\
  {\tt SNZ }     &           & Skip if $\mbox{A} \not= 0$ \\
  {\tt SNN }     &           & Skip if $\mbox{A} \geq 0$ \\
  {\tt SNN SNZ } & {\tt SPA} & Skip if $\mbox{A} > 0$ \\
  \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}\vspace{1em}

\paragraph{Why Two {\tt CLA} operations?}
\label{sec-cla2}
Superficially, having two {\tt CLA} operations is unnecessary, and wastes
space that could be used by another minor operation. However, clearing
\A{} is a very useful operation, and having it in both {\tt OP1} and
  {\tt OP2} makes it available to more use cases.

Both {\tt CLA} operations have the same bitfield value, \hex{080}. The
{\tt OP1 CLA} operation is \hex{C080}, and the {\tt OP2 CLA} operation
is \hex{D080}. To resolve the obvious ambiguity in the naming,
standard CFT Assembly {\tt always\/} defines {\tt CLA} as
\hex{C080}. This works in all three combinations of {\tt CLA}
appearances in instructions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{\tt CLA}:} the symbol table resolves this to {\tt C080},
  which is {\tt OP1 CLA}.
\item{\textbf{\tt OP1 CLA}:} since Assembly ORs all fields together,
  this results in \hex{C000 OR C080}, which is again \hex{C080}, or
  {\tt OP1 CLA}.
\item{\textbf{\tt OP2 CLA}:} again, ORring fields together yields
  \hex{D000 OR C080} which is \hex{D080}, which is {\tt OP2 CLA}.
\end{itemize}

The only minor drawback of this arrangement is that, should the
programmer somehow require the {\tt CLA} operation to be executed by
the {\tt OP2} instruction explicitly, {\tt OP2 CLA} must be specified
in full.

\subsubsection{{\tt LIA} â€” Load Immediate Address}
\label{sec-lia}
\label{sec-li}

Loads \A{} with the literal value specified in the instruction. The
page-relative form of this instruction is used to load \A{} with a
page-relative address.

When R=0, {\tt LIA} becomes the Load Immediate ({\tt LI}) instruction,
which can load a value in the range \hex{0000}â€“\hex{03FF} into \A.

This instruction always operates in the Immediate addressing mode. The
value of the instruction I bit is {\em ignored}.

\subsection{Standard Macros}
\subsubsection{{\tt RET} â€” Return from Subroutine}

This is defined as {\tt JMP I R 0000}. It jumps to the return address
saved by the {\tt JSR} instruction, which stores it at memory address
\hex{0000}.

\subsubsection{{\tt RTT} â€” Return from Trap} 

This is defined as {\tt JMP I R 0001}. It jumps to the return address
saved by the {\tt TRAP} instruction, which stores it at memory address
\hex{0001}.

\subsubsection{{\tt NEG} â€” Negate \A}

Obtains the two's complement of \A{} by performing {\tt OP1 NOT INC}.

\subsubsection{{\tt ING} â€” Increment and Negate \A}

Obtains the two's complement of \A{} and increases it, thereby
calculating $\mbox{AC} \leftarrow -(\mbox{AC} + 1)$. Due to the use of
twos complement work, this is equivalent to a simple {\tt OP1 NOT}.

\subsubsection{{\tt SEL} â€” Set L}

This macro sets \Lreg{} by combining the {\tt CLL} and {\tt
  CPL} instructions.

\subsubsection{{\tt LI} â€” Load Immediate}

This is equivalent to {\tt LIA R}. It loads \A{} with the 10-bit literal
value specified as operand. The most significant six bits are zero.

\subsubsection{{\tt SPA} â€” Skip if Positive \A}

This is equivalent to {\tt OP2 SNN SNZ}. It skips the next instruction
if \A{} is neither negative, nor zero (thus positive).

\subsubsection{{\tt SNP} â€” Skip if Non-Positive \A}

This is equivalent to {\tt OP2 SNA SZA}. It skips the next instruction
if \A{} is less than or equal to zero (non-positive).

\subsubsection{{\tt SBL}, {\tt SBR} â€” Bitwise shifts}

The two bitwise shift macros are formed by combining {\tt OP1 CLL} with
the corresponding {\tt OP1} roll operations. They provide bitwise
(unsigned arithmetic) shift operations which are fundamental in
implementing multiplication and division, among others.

Please note that there are no nybble-oriented shift operations because
there is no way to clear the lower order three bits of \A{} with an
{\tt OP1} instruction.

\subsection{Common Tasks}

This section shows how some common, simple Assembly language tasks can
be performed using the CFT instruction set.

\subsubsection{Addition With Carry}

The \Lreg{} flag may be used as carry in using this short program:
\begin{verbatim}
adc:   IFL INC      ; Skip if L=0
       ADD addr
\end{verbatim}

The program increases the Accumulator by one if the \Lreg{} register is set,
then performs addition as normal.

\subsubsection{Subtraction}

There is no explicit subtraction instruction, but the benefit of two's
complement is that one is unnecessary. Subtraction can be reduced to
addition as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
sub:    NEG         ; OP1 NOT INC
        ADD addr
\end{verbatim}

The program does a one's complement (binary negation) of the
accumulator, then increments it by one, which is a two's complement
(decimal negation). This is the {\tt NEG} macro. The addition is then
performed with the negative value of the Accumulator, to obtain the
value {\tt addr - AC}.

\subsubsection{Negation of a 32-bit Quantity}

The following code negates the two's complement representation of a
32-bit signed integer stored in locations {\tt xh} (high word) and
{\tt xl} (low word):

\begin{verbatim}
neg32:  SEL         ; Set carry
        LOAD xl     ; Negate low word
        NEG         ; Two's complement
        STORE xl

        LOAD xh     ; Negate high word
        IFL INC     ; Propagate carry
        NEG         ; Two's complement
        STORE xh
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Addition of two 32-bit Values}

To add two 32-bit values stored in locations {\tt al}, {\tt ah} (\A{} low
and high words respectively), and {\tt bl}, {\tt bh} (B low and high
words respectively), it is necessary to propagate the carry bit
stored in the \Lreg{} register:

\begin{verbatim}
add32:  CLL         ; Clear carry
        LOAD al     ; Load low A
        ADD bl      ; Add to low B
        STORE xl    ; Store it

        LOAD ah     ; Load high A
        IFL INC     ; Propagate carry
        ADD bh      ; Add to high B
        STORE xh
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Subtraction of two 32-bit Values}

This programs subtracts two signed, two's complement 32-bit values
stored in locations {\tt al}, {\tt ah} (\A{} low and high words
respectively), and {\tt bl}, {\tt bh} (B low and high words
respectively). It does so by negating B, storing it to the result
location X, and then adding \A{} to that location while propagating
carry.

\begin{verbatim}
sub32:  SEL         ; Set carry
        LOAD bl     ; Negate low word
        NEG         ; Two's complement
        STORE xl

        LOAD bh     ; Negate high word
        IFL INC     ; Propagate carry
        NEG         ; Two's complement
        STORE xh

        CLL         ; Clear carry
        LOAD al     ; Load low A
        ADD xl      ; AC = AC + -B
        STORE xl    ; Store it

        LOAD ah     ; Load high A
        IFL INC     ; Propagate carry
        ADD xh      ; Add to high B
        STORE xh    ; Store it.

%\subsubsection{Two's Complement of a 32-bit Quantity}
%
%There is no explicit subtraction instruction, but the benefit of two's
%complement is that one is unnecessary. Subtraction can be reduced to
%addition as follows:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%neg32:  SEL
%        ADD addr
%\end{verbatim}
%
%The program does a one's complement (binary negation) of the
%accumulator, then increments it by one, which is a two's complement
%(decimal negation). This is the {\tt NEG} macro. The addition is then
%performed with the negative value of the Accumulator, to obtain the
%value {\tt addr - A}.

\subsubsection{Bitwise Shifts}

To convert bitwise rolls to bitwise shifts, the \Lreg\ register needs
to be cleared before the roll takes place. The following code performs
a bitwise (or unsigned arithmetic) shift one bit to the right.

\begin{verbatim}
shr:    CLL RBR
\end{verbatim}

This operation is mathematically tantamount to
$\lfloor\mbox{\A}/2\rfloor$. Obviously, other roll instructions may be
substituted for {\tt RBR}. Please note that these shifts are already
available as the standard Assembly macros {\tt SBR}, {\tt SBL}, {\tt
  SNR} and {\tt SNL}.

\subsubsection{Arithmetic Shifts}

Sign-extending shifts are only slightly more involved.

\begin{verbatim}
asr:    CLL       ; Clear L (L=0)
        SNN       ; Skip if AC >= 0
        CPL       ;   AC < 0: toggle L (L=1)
        RBR       ;   Roll 1 bit right.
\end{verbatim}

At the end of this short program, the most significant (i.e. sign) bit
of \A\ will be the same as before. Due to the use of two's complement,
this is still equivalent to $\lfloor\mbox{\A}/2\rfloor$, but the
behaviour is now specialised to signed numbers.

\subsubsection{Bitwise Or of a Small Array}

The autoindex registers can be used to simplify short loops. Here, the
\A\ is loaded with the address of the first word of the array. The
first 5 elements of it will be ORred together, and the result left in
\A.

\begin{verbatim}
or6:    STORE R 80  ; Autoindex register
        LOAD I R 80 ; Load 1st value
        OR I R 80   ; OR with 2nd value
        OR I R 80   ; OR with 3rd value
        OR I R 80   ; OR with 4rd value
        OR I R 80   ; Or with 5th value
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Simple Loops}

This is a simple loop. It iterates as many times as the value of
\A\ on entry to the subroutine. In this example, the loop body sends
the hexadecimal value {\tt 2A} to an I/O device designated {\tt TTY0
  0}. The routine is expected to be called with {\tt JSR stars}.

\begin{verbatim}
stars:  NEG          ; AC = -AC
        STORE R 10   ; Loop variable
loop:   SNZ          ; AC = 0?
        RET          ;   Yes. Return.
        LIA 21       ; AC = 0021 (ASCII '!')
        OUT TTY0 0   ; Send it out.
        INCM R 10    ; Step the loop counter.
        JMP loop     ; Loop again.
\end{verbatim}

If the operating system has set up a Page Zero store of commonly used
constants, and it includes {\tt minus1} (which contains -1 ({\tt
  FFFF}), an easy alternate form of this loop using counter decrements
is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
stars:  STORE R 10   ; Loop variable
loop:   SNZ          ; AC = 0?
        RET          ;   Yes. Return.
        ADD minus1   ; Decrement loop counter
        STORE R 10   ; Store it back.
        LIA 21       ; AC = 0021 (ASCII '!')
        OUT TTY0 0   ; Send it out
        LOAD R 10    ; Load the loop counter.
        JMP loop     ; Loop again.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Sum of a Block of Words}

A somewhat more complex example leverages the Autoindex feature to
calculate the sum (modulo 65,536) of a block of words. A pointer to
the block of words should be stored at location \hex{0010}, and the
size (in words) should be in \A. On exit, memory address \hex{0012}
will contain the sum of the words.

\begin{verbatim}
sum_n:  NEG
        STORE R 11   ; Loop variable
        LOAD R 10    ; Array base
        STORE I R 80 ; Autoindex
        LI 0         ; 
        STORE I R 12 ; Sum = 0
        LOAD R 11    ; Number of words left
loop:   SNZ          ; Is it zero?
        RET          ;   Yes. Return.
        LOAD R 12    ; Load running total
        ADD I R 80   ; Sum a word
        STORE R 12   ; Store it back
        LOAD R 11    ; Loop variable
        INC          ; Increment
        STORE R 11   ; Store it back
        JMP loop     ; Loop again.
\end{verbatim}

%% The CFT implements three buses.

%% \subsection{Internal Bus (IBus)}

%% This bus is used to connect the computer's main units
%% together. Various auxilliary signals control what units connect to
%% this bus and in what way.

%% \subsection{Address Bus (ABus)}

%% The address bus is driven with the contents of the \MAR whenever main
%% memory or an I/O device is being accessed.

%% \subsection{Data Bus (DBus)}

%% The data bus is directly connected to the IBus whenever a memory or
%% I/O read or write operation is in progress.
