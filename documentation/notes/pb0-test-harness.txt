Passive tests:

* High impedance between VCC and GND.
* RESET# pulled up.
* WS# pulled up.
* ENDEXT# pulled up.
* HALT# pulled up.
* RESET# pulled up.
* [R1]# pulled up.
* RAGL# pulled up.
* RPC# pulled up.
* RDR# pulled up.
* RAC# pulled up.
* [R6]# pulled up.
* [R7]# pulled up.
* [W1]# pulled up.
* WAR# pulled up.
* WPC# pulled up.
* WIR# pulled up.
* WDR# pulled up.
* WAC# pulled up.
* WALU# pulled up.
* RUNIT0-3 pulled down.
* WUNIT0-2 pulled down.
* OPIF0-3 pulled down.

Active tests:

* UPC: µPC counts up (note: with microcode ROMs installed it will
  reset before it hits 16).
* UPC: µPC stops counting on HALT# or RESET#.
* UPC: µPC resets to zero on RESET#.
* RUNIT: changes to indicate register reads.
* WUNIT: changes to indicate register writes.
* MEM#: should strobe to indicate memory reads.
* R#: should strobe to indicate memory reads.
* UCB: UCB0-3 reset to 0000.
* UCB: UCBA/UCBB# clear on reset.
* UCB0-3: stay at 0000 while the board runs.
* Front panel pins reflect machine state.


Test harness:

11 input signals need to be driven.

* CLK4 ticking clocks toe µPC counter.
* CLK1 = 1 to enable RUNIT decoders.
* CLK3 = 0 to enable WUNIT decoders.
* IR11-IR15 select microprogram to test (optional)
* RSTHOLD# is 0 to test reset microprogram. Disconnect = 1 = instruction test.
* IRQS# = 1.
* SYSDEV# = 1.
* W# = 1.
