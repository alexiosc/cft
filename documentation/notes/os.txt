Bank 7: E000-FFFF: Usually (but not necessarily) basic OS services.

==Boot-time Bank Map==

When booting, banks 4-7 are all mapped with ROM. The extra ROM mapped
is used to discover and initialise devices.

==Forth's Use of Banking==

Each dictionary must fit inside one 8 kW bank (heaps of space,
usually).

The compiler checks which dictionary the currently compiled word is
in. If it's different to that of the previously compiled word, it adds
bank switching code and relocates the word address.

There will be a lot of bank switching, so this must be a Forth
primitive in assembly.

===Large data structures?===

Add multi-bank Forth words to read/copy data longer than 8kW, or allow
banks to be set up in specific layouts (that would still only allow
access to up to 40kW).

==List of Banks==

==Services==

Some notes on needed OS services and abstraction layers.

===Memory===

* Allocate static memory (not very granular)
* Dellocate static memory
* Map bank

===TTY STRUCTURE===

Abstracts output to a terminal. There are three types of terminals at
the moment: the DFP's basic terminal, TTY-based terminals, and the VDU
terminal, which is emulated.

Basic calls:

* Open (initialise)
* Close
* Clear to send?
* Send word
* Ready to receive?
* Receive word (buffered, via ISR)

===VDU/KBD===

Provides direct access to the VDU.

Services:
  * Set mode
  * Load character set
  * Fill with char/attribute
    * Clear screen
    * Clear line left
    * Clear line right
  * Scroll
    * Down/Up
    * Hardware scroll unless windowed
    * Software scroll if windowed
  * Set window
  * Reset window
  * Move cursor (CAR/HAR)
  * Set cursor colour/blink mode (CCR)
  * Set colour/attributes
  * Write text
  * Write text in graphics mode

  * Keyboard data available?
  * Read raw keyboard data
  * Read cooked keyboard data (via ISR)
  * Write to keyboard (bit banging)

VDU Variables:

  * Screen width, height
  * Screen start (x,y), end (x,y)
  * Window start (x,y), end (x,y)
  * Cursor location (as vector address and separate words: eases arithmetic)
  * Current attribute

===IDE/FDC===

Used for hard disks and floppies, possibly TTY-based ‘network’ block
devices.

Abstraction:

  * Probe for units, return list
  * Open (initialise)
  * Close
  * Select unit
  * Get size (in 256 word blocks)
  * Read block
  * Write block
  * Read status

===Storage===

  One layer above the IDE/FDC layer.

  * Probe label, return volumes
  * Select volume and open (attach)
  * Close
  * Get size (in 256 word blocks)
  * Read block
  * Write block
  * Read status

===Filesystem===

  One layer above the storage layer.

  * Open filesystem
  * Close
  * Get stats (size, used, etc.)
  * Directories:
    * Open directory
    * Read descriptor
    * Close directory
  * Change working directory
  * Open file
  * Read from file
  * Seek
  * Write
  * Close file

==Interrupts==

The CFT can operate on one interrupt line (no IRC card) or eight (IRC
available).

Without an IRC, all interrupts arrive as IRQ signals. The ISR needs to
check each available device.

With an IRC, the main ISR checks the IRC ISR (Interrupt Status
Register) and calls individual ISRn routines.

Both ISR and ISRn routines are in ROM, and the IRQ mapping will
probably be hardwired in the ROM OS.

Registers ISRVEC and ISRnVEC can be used to install user handlers for
interrupts. They contain the address of a user handler. Normally, they
point to the end of the ISR. When a user routine is installed, it
copies the ISRVEC or ISRnVEC value to its ‘own’ memory, puts its own
address in that register, and JMPs to the stored address when it's
done. This allows daisy chaining of user interrupt routines.

==Terminals==

All user input/output comes from/goes to the current ‘A’ terminal,
whatever that may be. That's usually the TTYA_xxx jump registers. To
send a character, it's usually enough to TRAP p0.TTYA_SEND with the
character to send in p0.ARG0.

Build a basic terminal for the VDU port so essential directives will
work all the time. Software needing a VDU must detect it on start and
abort.

==OS Calls==

OS Calls are TRAPs. They accept arguments in the ARGn registers, and
return values in the RETn registers.

Most calls use RET0 to return a result code, often 0 or 1 (often &FFFF
in case of error).

The page 0 register ERRNO stores the last error encountered.

==Multiuser Operation==

This is fairly easy with the MBU. On the CFT, page 0 is in practice a
very large register file. With memory banking, we can swap this
register file for any other.

A context switch would then execute this algorithm:

* Save L, AC, PC (in context's page 0)
* Map another physical bank to &0000–1FFF.
* Restore L, AC, PC.

Page 0 is 1 KW long, but a memory bank is 8 KW long. This allows up to
7 KW of user data (e.g. Forth user variables, buffers and stacks) to
be saved along with everything else. The entire state of the system
should fit in this 8KW quite easily (possibly with space to spare).

==Asynchronous Operation==

With async operation, we can have multiple user contexts in a
pseudo-multitasking environment. We could even have pre-emptive
multitasking using timer interrupts.

===Blocking I/O===

Suggest having a system call or macro wait(TTYA) whenever input is
expected. Check flag (set by ISR), loop if not set, return character
received on success.

Right now, the ISR can clear this flag.

With multi-user extensions later, the macro can relinquish control to
the OS while the process is waiting for I/O.

Use a static, low number of threads (e.g. 16).

To avoid synchronisation issue, use a state machine for each process
just like modern OS, but much simpler:

    +-----+     +------+  :  +---------+
    | RUN |---->| WAIT |--:->| WAITING |
    +-----+     +------+  :  +---------+
       \                  :       |
        +-----------------:-------+
                          :
                          :--> other processes are scheduled here.

==Interrupt Allocation==

Tentative allocation, may change a lot.

Considerations:

  * Querying the DFP is VERY slow. Keep IRQ6 disabled on it unless necessary.

  * With shared interrupts, check faster devices before slow
    devices. The DFP is always last.

  * IRQ0 shouldn't be shared (simplifies the ISR).

  * The ISR treats the interrupts as prioritised in order. Since IRQs
    can't be reconfigured easily, this prioritisation may change in
    software.
