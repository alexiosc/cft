==3.3-to-5V Shifting==

The MAX V

* The Max V CPL tolerates up to 4V for input.
* It provides ≥2.4V for output.

Bus Hold Drivers

* The 74ACT107[13] bus hold drivers hold the bus at 5V.
* They accept ≥1.6V (typical; ≥2V worst-case) as the minimum HIGH voltage.

Other HC ICs:

* Use 5V.
* Accept ≥3.7V (typical) for VIH.

The 74ACT245:

* Drives 5V
* Accepts ≥1.5V (typical; ≥2V worst-case).




* MAX V Drives the bus (with 5V-powered '245)

The Max V outputs ≥2.4V to drive high.
The 'ACT245 reads ≥2V as high.
The 'ACT245 correctly outputs ~5V.

* CFT Drives the bus (with 5V-powered '245)

The 'ACT245 reads ~5V.
The 'ACT245 outputs ~5V (which is the >4V maximum tolerance)



* (NOT WORKING) MAX V Drives the bus (with 3.3V-powered '245)

The Max V outputs ≥2.4V to drive high.
The 'ACT245 reads ≥2V as high.
The 'ACT245 correctly outputs ~3.3V.
(CHECK EXPERIMENTALLY!) The CFT bus hold reads ≥1.6V as high and clamps to 5V.

* CFT Drives the bus (with 3.3V-powered '245)

The 'ACT245 reads ~5V (which is higher than the absolute VI rating, 3.3V+0.5V = 3.8V)
The 'ACT245 outputs ~5V (which is the >4V maximum tolerance)
