# DFP: Debugging Front Panel Version 2

This is the DFP 2, a combination of the Debugging Board (DEB) and
Programmer's Front Panel Board (PFP). It provides two-way bridging
between:

1. The CFT Computer or *parts* of the computer.
2. The Front Panel.
3. A remote computer (or human) performing tests and diagnostics.

The third component is optional.
