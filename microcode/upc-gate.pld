DESCRIPTION

MBU GAL EQUATIONS

Inputs: (active low unless otherwise stated)

CLK          -- built-in clock of the GAL/PLD. Registers equation results.
RESET        -- An active-low reset signal
HALT         -- The CPU is halted when low
WAITING      -- We are in the Wait State when low.
END1         -- End of instruction (from Control Unit or bus)
END2         -- End of instruction (from bus or Control Unit)

Outputs: (registered on the rising edge of Clock)

CET      -- Enables counting (on the rising edge of CLK4)
CEP      -- Functionally identical to CET, and currently controlled by the same equation.
PE       -- Active low. Parallel enable (sets ÂµPC to 0000 on rising edge of CLK4).
