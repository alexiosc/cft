	[Cons/Hardware/PFP/Light_Assembly/LED_Boards=70] 6 of 8 boards
	populated with SMD parts.

2013-07-07  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Setback,Des/Hardware/PB0] Bug discovered in PB0 µCB extension:
	executing the Interrupt Service Routing cancels any temporarily
	set bank. Proposed fix is to AND the INT input to the microcode
	store with the temporary bank enable, making a temporary bank
	switch and the instruction following it an atomic operation (as
	far as interrupts are concerned). The design for this is still not
	in place and will have to be patched in because the PB0 boards
	have already been shipped.

	[Des/Hardware/PB1/Routing=80] PB1 routing.

	[Des/PB2/Schematic] Changed semantics of MBU's enable bit. 0 is
	on, 1 is off. Makes it faster to change banks (no additional OR is
	required). Makes it harder to turn off banking, which is a very
	uncommon operation.

	[Code/Emulator] Synchronised emulator with new I/O map.

	[Code/Emulator] Rewrote MBU emulation.

	[Code/Software/ROM/Forth] Changed code to accommodate new I/O map.

	[Orders,Milestones] Processor Board 0 (the Microcode Store) PCBs
	arrive.

2013-07-12  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Setback,Des/Hardware/PB0/Routing] The wrong version of PB0 was
	printed! The CAM job processed the right files (revision C), but the
	ZIP script zipped up revision A, even after I verified the
	Gerbers. I'll need to re-order PB0. On the upside, I fixed the IRQS#
	bug in the µCB extension and rerouted the board using the TSSOP-48
	16-bit buffers I ordered by mistake. The new PB0 passes ERC and DRC and
	has been rendered front and back, as usual.

2013-07-13  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PB1] Investigating use of the DS1805 I²C-programmable
	clock generator on PB1. It'll allow the processor frequency to be
	changed for testing, and also takes up less space than a traditional
	oscillator.

	[Des/Hardware/VDU] Investigating use of the DS1805L I²C-programmable
	clock generator on the VDU. The CPLD can program it via I²C and we can
	support arbitrary pixel clocks up to 33 MHz (pixel clocks are currently
	half the frequency of the CPLD clock). Mostly, it'll be able to
	generate lower frequencies to drive, for instance, old-style 15 kHz RGB
	monitors (at lower resolutions, of course).

2013-07-14  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PB0] Realised need for pull-ups for all input
	signals. Added pull-ups. Since I'm reworking PB0 anyway,
	investigating removing the microcode store connector altogether,
	in favour of the control bus. Most of the signals are there
	anyway. However, this requires moving the unit decoders to PB0
	too. Added SMT resistor arrays for impedance matching on all
	outputs.

	[Des/Hardware/PB1] Reworking PB1 to remove microcode store
	connector in favour of the control bus. Through-hole resistor nets
	to be removed in favour of SMT resistor arrays.

	[Setback,Des/Hardware/PB2] PB2 was not receiving DEC# signal from
	the microcode store because DEC# was never assigned a control bus
	pin! Reworked control bus to add this. Merged INCCPL# and DECCPL#
	signals into ACCPL# using an AND gate on PB2.

	[Des/Hardware/PB3] PB3 must be reworked to incorporate the merged
	INCCPL# and DECCPL# signals. This may save up to two gates.

	[Des/Hardware/Control_Bus] Reworking signals needed for the
	control bus, merging in signals used in the microcode connector
	with a view to removing it altogether.

	[Sim,Des/Hardware] Refactored Verilog code to account for changes
	in processor design.

	[Des/Hardware/PB0] Minor routing fixes. Re-rendered.

	[Des/Hardware/PB1] Placing PB1 almost from scratch. Without the unic
	decoders and separate microcode store connector, there's a lot more
	space for routing and the process is expect to be considerably less
	painful than previous revisions of the board.

	Assembly or binary formats.

2013-08-26  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	ups. Beginnings of rewriting of the lost code.

2013-09-05  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Setback,Testing/Hardware/PB1] Outputs of SBL muxes are not pulled
	up (they are tristated when idle). This implies the three-input
	NOR gate is superfluous too, but better safe than sorry (the
	external input, ENDEXT#, could be pulled up by mistake).

	[Cons/Hardware/PB1=80] Finished top side of PB1, surface mount
	components only.

	[Testing/Hardware/PB1] Drew up PB1 testing plan.

	[Orders] Screws and front panel hardware.

2013-09-06  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

2013-09-21  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Fixed issues with front panel assembly diagram.

	[Orders] PB3 ordered.

2013-09-24  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Drafted rack mount case outlines, started changing
	front panel to fit.

2013-09-25  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Setback,Testing/Hardware/PB0] OPIF0 and FL are buffered but not
	connected to the front panel connector on PB0. There is a single spare
	pin (pin 38, previously grounded), now assigned to OPIF0 in the
	revision F PB0 board. This is less a problem than it seems, because
	both OPIF0 and FL are present on the control bus, and can be buffered
	and forwarded over to the control panel lights on the control panel
	controller (PFP) board.

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Worked on Front Panel schematics.

	[Orders] PB2 arrived.

2013-10-09  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Worked on Front Panel schematics. Started splitting
	PFP into PFP controller, switch break-out board and light break-out
	board. All three are through-hole.

	[Orders] Generated BOM for PB2, PB3 and PFP. Ordered parts for PB2, PB3
	and PFP.

2013-10-10  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Orders] Ordered components for PB2, PB3 and PFP boards, plus
	leftover parts for wiring the front panel itself.

2013-10-15  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Setback, Des/Hardware/PFP] Rev C PFP schematics are done, but the
	chip count is too high to implement on even a double-sized
	PCB. Now considering merging the DEB (debugging) board and PFP so
	that I can use a microcontroller to implement switch debouncing,
	lock-out and registration (12 ICs) as well as the switch operation
	state machine (11 ICs) and part of the start/stop state machine (7
	ICs).

	This would remove some redundancies (e.g. both PFP and DEB
	implement HALT instructions), and possibly allow a ‘virtual’ front
	panel where the computer may be debugged and operated via a serial
	port.

	The lights would still be driven directly by hardware, of course,
	since the MCU would be too slow to update them all (and not have
	anywhere near the enough I/O pins).

2013-10-17  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Completed schematics for amalgamated PFP & DEB
	board. 31 shift registers working as I/O expanders for the MCU! I
	can use the 6U (double-height) board and connectors previously
	meant to host the hand-routed PB2.

	[Cons/Hardware/PB2=50] Placed and reflowed the bottom side of PB2.

	[Cons/Hardware/PB3=50] Placed and reflowed the bottom side of
	PB3. The top side will have to be done when the hard to find
	74HC670 arrive.

2013-10-18  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Cons/Hardware/PB2=100] Finished construction of PB2.

2013-10-21  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Software/Filesystem] Restored C filesystem code functionality:
	cftdt can now create Level 0, 1 and 2 files and can dump filesystem
	blocks in hex.

2013-10-22  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Software/Filesystem] Added file extraction support and debugged
	file writing. cftdt now has the essential features needed to create CFT
	disk images, with the exception of file deletion (which won't be needed
	until the CFT side can create and write files).

2013-10-24  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Software/Filesystem] Added file removal support.

2013p-10-27  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Cons/Hardware/PB3=90] Finished construction of PB3.

	[Code/Software/ROM/Forth] Fixed TTY input bug that would only read one
	character per interrupt from TTY FIFOs.

2013-10-28  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Cons/Hardware/PB3=100] Programmed and labeled Flash ROMs.

	[Orders] Ordered additional components needed for the PFP/DEB
	board.

2013-10-30  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Hardware/PFP/Firmware] Worked on the PFP/DEB joint firmware.

	[Orders] The ribbon cable I ordered on Ebay was probably lost en
	route. Jumped the gun and bought 10m of 50-way ribbon from the
	high street. The price was comparable.

2013-10-31  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Orders] Mouser order with PFP/DEB components arrived. The order
	also included Intersil 82C54 ICs needed to build the timer board
	and a second 16C2550 dual UART for the second half of the TTY
	board. I am now stocked to build the processor, PFP/DEB, interrupt
	controller, timer and IDE host adaptor boards.

	[Cons/Hardware/PFP] Crimped the Molex side of the front panel
	lights wiring loom (190 hand-crimped pins).

2013-11-01  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Cons/Hardware] Cleaned all four processor boards.

2013-11-02  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Hardware/PFP/Firmware] Worked on the PFP/DEB joint firmware.

2013-11-03  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Code/Hardware/PFP/Firmware] Worked on the PFP/DEB joint firmware.

	[Setback,Des/Hardware/PB1] Discovered a potential race condition in the
	interrupt state machine: if interrupts are re-enabled right before an
	RTI macro, there is a very minor chance the ISR will be re-entered
	before it exits. Like the PDP-8, the CFT is non-reentrant, and this can
	cause issues. The flaw can be fixed in microcode (by finding some place
	to add an atomic RTI instruction), or in software, by saving the ISR
	return address onto a stack (the Forth Return stack is an ideal
	choice). The latter choice is easier, of course, although it increases
	interrupt latency.

2013-11-08  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Second attempt to separate the PFP
	into two boards. This one uses a 13 IC daughterboard.

	[Setback,Cons/Hardware/PFP] Wired half of the front panel switch
	assembly before realising the loom was laid out the wrong way. I will
	have to do this all over. Separated flat cable turned out to be
	aesthetically displeasing, anyway. The next wiring attempt will use
	Kynar wire. Easier to bundle into a loom and easier to deal with. The
	wires may terminate on a small PCB with a 50-pin female socket, which
	will in turn connect to the PFP board using flat cable.

2013-11-09  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Redesigned the front panel fascia with the key
	locks moved to the bottom and the µCB display to the left of the
	IR (so it appears as the IR MSB nybble, which it is).

	[Misc] Created CFT Project logo, version 2. This is cleaner, and
	probably renders better on the CFT itself.

2013-11-15  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Des/Hardware/PFP] Reworked the front panel assembly, preparing
	for laser cutting on acrylic. The LED modules fit on the LED
	module assembly, and the switches are fastened to a smaller switch
	sub-assembly, on spacers. The front panel fascia then attaches to
	the LED assembly completing the design.

	[Cons/Hardware/PFP] Rewired the switch side of the switch assembly
	with kynar wire.

2013-11-16  AC <alexios@bedroomlan.org>

	[Cons/Hardware/PFP] Wired the switches to the switch break-out
	board.
