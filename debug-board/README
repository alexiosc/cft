	     SIMPLE AVR-BASED SERIAL/USB FLASH PROGRAMMER

	 http://www.bedroomlan.org/hardware/flash-programmer

This is a design for a simplistic Flash programmer using an AVR
Atmega-8 microcontroller, three 74164 ICs and a handful of passive
components.

The hardware design was inspired by Jay Kominek's Parallel port EEPROM
programmer, which is available at:

	  http://www.miranda.org/~jkominek/hardware/eeprom/

Since parallel ports are becoming rare, I embellished the design by
using an AVR microcontroller to do the hard work, and an FTDI
USB-to-serial cable to take care of communications and supplying
power.

The design works by using three 74x164 serial-in-parallel-out shift
registers to buffer the address pins of the EPROM/EEPROM/Flash chip,
and using eight pins on the Atmega for the data. Chip control signals
are connected directly to the Atmega for easier control (and safety).

This allows for 24bit (128Mbit or 8x16 MByte) parts to be programmed
(if you are patient enough) using only 15 pins on the microcontroller.

The control software allows for a modest amount of human
interactivity, although you'll need a microcontroller with more than
8K of Flash RAM for a better feature set.

A Python program (flashprog) takes care of the computer-side of
things. It allows you to read, write, verify and erase parts. The
Python program (and some of the microcontroller firmware) were written
to cover my own needs, so there are absolutely no guarantees the
software will work for parts other than the ones I have handy.
